# solid-software-engineering-test
My answer to a technical test request (only 1 hr spent)

Improvement to add include: 
DI Framework

Additional tests for other customer / company combinations
Additional unit tests to cover repo etc
Proper namespacing

This is just a flavour of how I would refactor the code
I wrote this with VS 2017
I wrote this TDD and mocked external dependencies
The unit tests are passing
 and everything builds and works
