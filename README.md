# solid-software-engineering-test
My answer to a technical test request (only 1 hr spent)
This is just a flavour of how I would refactor the code. 
I wrote this with VS 2017 using Moq nuget package. I wrote this TDD and mocked external dependencies

The unit tests are passing and everything builds and works!

Improvements to add include: 

DI Framework

Additional tests for other customer / company combinations

Additional unit tests to cover repo etc

Proper namespacing
